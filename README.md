🚀 Installation
On the main GitHub page for this repo, click the green Code button.

Select Download ZIP.

Find the downloaded .zip file on your computer and unzip it. (You can usually right-click and select "Extract All..."). This will create a new folder.

Open your browser (like Chrome, Brave, or Edge) and go to the extensions management page.

For Chrome/Brave: chrome://extensions

For Edge: edge://extensions

In the top-right corner, find the Developer mode toggle and turn it ON.

A new set of buttons will appear. Click the Load unpacked button.

A file window will open. Select the entire folder that you just unzipped (the one containing manifest.json, not the .zip file itself).

The extension is now installed! Enjoy your regular eye breaks.
